## ✨ My Personal Takeaways ✨

> "Completing this course has been an incredible learning experience, covering everything from supervised and unsupervised learning to reinforcement learning and advanced algorithms like decision trees and tree ensembles. The highlight for me was understanding how to tackle overfitting and underfitting, and knowing exactly what to do (and not do) when my models face high bias or high variance. It's a little disappointing about the Coursera policy change and not getting the certificate, but the wealth of knowledge gained far outweighs that. A big thank you to Coursera, Andrew Ng, and Stanford Online for this fantastic course!"
