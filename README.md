This repository chronicles my exploration of the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera, guided by the expertise of Stanford University and DeepLearning.AI. 

## 📚 Course Highlights 

* 🧠 Supervised Learning: Mastered linear and logistic regression, building predictive models for various tasks.
* 🤖 Neural Networks:  Built and trained neural networks with TensorFlow for multi-class classification.
* 🌳 Decision Trees & Ensembles: Explored decision trees, random forests, and boosting techniques for robust models
* 🕵️‍♀️ Unsupervised Learning:  Applied clustering and anomaly detection to uncover hidden patterns in data
* 🛍️ Recommender Systems: Built recommender systems using collaborative filtering and content-based approaches.
* 🤖 Deep Reinforcement Learning: Delved into the world of deep reinforcement learning, training agents to make optimal decisions.
